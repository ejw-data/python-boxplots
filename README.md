## Overview  
<hr>  

This repo was created to test the different python boxplot packages and determine the different requirements needed and options available with each package.  I am also using the penguin dataset and pandas to manipulate my data into an initial standard form.   

Also included is a tutorial notebook explaining how boxplots work with examples.

## Data Source
The data for this example comes from Kaggle: [Palmer Archipelago (Antartica) penguin data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data?resource=download&select=penguins_size.csv).  For convenience, the two data files have been added to the `data` folder.
